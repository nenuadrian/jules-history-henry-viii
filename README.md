# The Six Wives of Henry VIII - Website

This project is a simple informational website about the six wives of King Henry VIII of England.

## Files Included

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the content about each wife.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file used for basic styling of the website.
*   `images/`: A directory intended to hold images of the wives.

## Content

The website provides a brief biography and the fate of each of Henry VIII's six wives:
1.  Catherine of Aragon
2.  Anne Boleyn
3.  Jane Seymour
4.  Anne of Cleves
5.  Catherine Howard
6.  Catherine Parr

## Images

The `images/` directory is provided, and `style.css` includes basic styling for images. However, due to restrictions on automated downloads from potential sources like Wikimedia Commons (related to `robots.txt`), images were not automatically included in this version.

To add images:
1.  Find suitable public domain or appropriately licensed images for each wife.
2.  Save them into the `images/` directory (e.g., `catherine_of_aragon.jpg`).
3.  Add `<img>` tags to `index.html` within each wife's respective `<article>` section, for example:
    `<img src="images/catherine_of_aragon.jpg" alt="Portrait of Catherine of Aragon">`

## How to View

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
